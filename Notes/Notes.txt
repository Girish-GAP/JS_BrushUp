Strings and array are different, all array methods don't work on Strings.

- how we itterate array & object & Strings


const str = "klAABDFAAA";
console.log(str.split('A'));
// [ 'kl', '', 'BDF', '', '', '' ]



// make a function which will return the count of number occurance from arr using object as map.

// Find the GCD of Two Numbers
// Generate a Random Number Between Two Values



// If I am not able to solve this means there is something i don't know, may be lang specific feature or trick or way

// Practice on promise


// what will happen if i am looping through the arr and in iteration adding the element in same arr

// recurssion 
2625. Flatten Deeply Nested Array


Would you like me to write a “Deep Recursion Pattern Note (Objects, Arrays, Trees)” next —
with visual diagrams and step-by-step reasoning to help you see how recursion builds results from the bottom up (for problems like Compact Object, Flatten, Clone, etc.)?

// 2694. Event Emitter


// regex is pending
// what is deepclone
// if string is primitive and not mutable why it's like array ?
// arr.size(); // and similar

// what is mean unmutatable if we can change the value ?
let str = "ABCD";
console.log(str); // ABCD
str = str.slice(1);
console.log(str) // BCD
